# Overview
The terms REST and RESTful spark in the mind varying definitions for everyone who reads them. The following definitions are provided to avoid confusion.  These definitions may, or may not, comport with the canonical definition of REST, let alone even begin to argue what that concept is.  The purpose served here is to remove any uncertainty for users of this particular API. 

# Resource Operations
The only goal is to achieve consistent use within the protocol definition here. To aid in this consistency, especially with regard to related projects, this API supports the resource operation definitions described in the [Kubernetes API Specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.7/#resource-operations).  

This simple approach uses a functional mapping between the standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations and HTTP methods.  The functional mapping of resource operations to HTTP verbs is defined as follows:
* Create - POST
* Read - GET
* Update - PUT (replace in whole) or PATCH (update in part)
* Delete - DELETE

In addition, the API supports all the standard protocol conventions with respect to the idempotency of actions related to HTTP Requests and caching of HTTP Responses. 

# API Specification
The API Specification for the project's master branch is available here: [Swagger.io Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samsung-cnct/krak8s/master/swagger/swagger.json#)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The only authoritative definition of the resources and endpoints defined for any instance of the API, as well as the methods that are supported for a given resource, is the OpenAPI (aka Swagger 2.0) definition generated by the running API Server itself.  The API Specification link above is provided for convenience, but it is the representation of the API design that is accessible on the master branch of this online repository **only**.

## Resources 
In an effort to keep this project as DRY as possible, the following is minimalist description of the resources defined for the interface.

The following are the major categories of resources administered by the API.

* OpenAPI - The OpenAPI (Swagger 2.0) specification for this interface
* Swagger - The Swagger 2.0 (OpenAPI) specification for this interface
* Projects Collection - The primary unit of isolation for users, tennant, teams, etc... 
  * Namespaces Collection - The project's namespace(s), e.g. "proj-dev", "prog-test", "prog-prod" 
  * Applications Collection - The namespace's installed applications
  * Cluster - The namespace's Kraken orchestrated Kubernetes cluster resources object 

## Order of Operations
There are two restriction on the ordering of operations for the API. 

1. The `namespace` resource *must* be created (POST) before a `cluster` resource can be created.  Any attempt to perform an operation on the `cluster` endpoint when no `namespace` endpoint is defined will return an error response code.

1. The `cluster` resource *must* be created (POST) before an `application` resource can be created.  Any attempt to perform an operation on the `application` endpoint when no `cluster` endpoint is defined will return an error response code.  While not strictly necessary, it is preferable to read the status of the `cluster` endpoint and check that the cluster resources are in an "active" state, as shown below before performing additional operations.  If the cluster resources are not ready when an application is deployed, then the create request will still be accepted however the application deployment may timeout (faile) and subsequently need to be resubmitted.
```
Status: 200 (Ok)
{
  "type": "cluster",
  "id": "de2760b1",
  "nodePoolSize": 3,
  "state": "create_requested"
  "created_at": "1988-11-12T15:18:46-08:00",
}
```

## Example Usage

The following example uses the commonly available `curl` command to create and retrieve objects from the API.  Note that in all the following examples the JSON output has been run through a formatter for improved readability.  The JSON pretty printing process is not shown here.

1. Create (POST) an initial project, then read (GET) it back
```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"name":"acme"}' http://localhost:8080/v1/projects 
{
	"created_at": "2017-08-11T22:03:46.021222713-07:00",
	"id": "d1226f6a",
	"name": "acme",
	"namespaces": null,
	"type": "project"
}

# GET the projects collection
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects
[{
	"created_at": "2017-08-11T22:03:46.021222713-07:00",
	"id": "d1226f6a",
	"name": "acme",
	"namespaces": null,
	"type": "project"
}]

# Alternately - GET just the single project
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/a0b4574a
{
	"created_at": "2017-08-11T22:03:46.021222713-07:00",
	"id": "d1226f6a",
	"name": "acme",
	"namespaces": null,
	"type": "project"
}
```
2. Create (POST) a namespace in the newly created project, and read (GET) it back.
```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"name":"acme-prod"}' http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/namespaces
{
	"applications": null,
	"created_at": "2017-08-11T22:04:48.613174018-07:00",
	"id": "20b5bac8",
	"name": "acme-prod",
	"resources": null,
	"type": "namespace"
}

# GET the namespaces collection
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/namespaces
[{
	"applications": null,
	"created_at": "2017-08-11T22:04:48.613174018-07:00",
	"id": "20b5bac8",
	"name": "acme-prod",
	"resources": null,
	"type": "namespace"
}]

# Alternately - GET just the single namespace
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/namespaces/20b5bac8
{
	"applications": null,
	"created_at": "2017-08-11T22:04:48.613174018-07:00",
	"id": "20b5bac8",
	"name": "acme-prod",
	"resources": null,
	"type": "namespace"
}
```
3. Create (POST) a cluster resources specification in the newly created namespace, and read (GET) it back.
```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"namespace_id":"20b5bac8", "nodePoolSize": 7}' \
       http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/cluster
{
	"created_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
	"id": "c7454a66",
	"namespace_id": "20b5bac8",
	"nodePoolSize": 7,
	"state": "create_requested",
	"type": "Resource"
}

# GET the cluster resources specification
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/cluster/c7454a66
{
	"created_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
	"id": "c7454a66",
	"namespace_id": "20b5bac8",
	"nodePoolSize": 7,
	"state": "create_requested",
	"type": "Resource"
}
```
4. Create (POST) an application in to the namespace in the project, and read (GET) it back.
```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"name": "AcmeWidgetPipeline", "version": "v1.0.0-alpha.2", "namespace_id":"20b5bac8"}' \ http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/applications
{
	"id": "99bf7a79",
	"name": "AcmeWidgetPipeline",
	"namespace_id": "20b5bac8",
	"status": null,
	"type": "application",
	"version": "v1.0.0-alpha.2"
}

# GET the applications collection for the namespace
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"namespaceid":"20b5bac8"}' http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/applications
[{
	"id": "99bf7a79",
	"name": "AcmeWidgetPipeline",
	"namespace_id": "20b5bac8",
	"status": null,
	"type": "application",
	"version": "v1.0.0-alpha.2"
}]

# Alternately - GET just the single application
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/applications/99bf7a79
{
	"id": "99bf7a79",
	"name": "AcmeWidgetPipeline",
	"namespace_id": "20b5bac8",
	"status": null,
	"type": "application",
	"version": "v1.0.0-alpha.2"
}
```
5. Note that, as we've been creating objects in the API that have relationships with existing objects, those existing objects have been incrementally updated with references to the newly created elements.
```
# Repeat the GET on the project object
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a
{
	"created_at": "2017-08-11T22:03:46.021222713-07:00",
	"id": "d1226f6a",
	"name": "acme",
	"namespaces": [{
		"oid": "20b5bac8",
		"url": "/v1/projects/d1226f6a/namespaces/20b5bac8"
	}],
	"type": "project"
}

# Repeat the GET on the namespace object
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/d1226f6a/namespaces/20b5bac8
{
	"applications": [{
		"oid": "99bf7a79",
		"url": "/v1/projects/d1226f6a/applications/99bf7a79"
	}],
	"created_at": "2017-08-11T22:04:48.613174018-07:00",
	"id": "20b5bac8",
	"name": "acme-prod",
	"resources": {
		"oid": "c7454a66",
		"url": "/v1/projects/d1226f6a/cluster/c7454a66"
	},
	"type": "namespace"
}
```
