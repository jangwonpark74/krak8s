# Overview
The terms REST and RESTful spark in the mind with varying defintions for everyone who reads them, we provide the following definitions to avoid confusions.  This may, or may not, comport with the canonical defition of REST, let alone even begin to argue what that concept is.  Rather the only goal here is remove doubt for users of this particular API. 

# Resource Operations
The only goal is to achive consistent use within the protocol definition here only. To aid in consistency with related projects, this API supports the resource operation definitions described in the [Kubernetes API Specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.7/#resource-operations).  

This simple approach uses a functional mapping between the standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations and HTTP methods.  The functional mapping of resource operations to HTTP verbs is defined as follows:
* Create - POST
* Read - GET
* Update - PUT (replace in whole) or PATCH (update in part)
* Delete - DELETE

In addition, the API supports all the standard protocol conventions with respect to the idempotency of actions related to HTTP Requests and caching of HTTP Responses. 

# API Specification
The API Specification for the project's master branch is available here: [OpenAPI Spec](http://swagger.goa.design/?url=samsung_cnct%2Fkrak8s%2Fdesign)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The only authoritative definition of the resources and endpoints defined for any instance of the API, as well as the methods that are supported for a given resource, is the OpenAPI (aka Swagger 2.0) definition generated by the running API Server itself.  The API Specification link above is provided for convenience, but it is the represenation of the API design that is accessible on the master branch of this online repository **only**.

In an effort to keep this project as DRY as possbile, there is only a top level description of the resources defined for the interface.
